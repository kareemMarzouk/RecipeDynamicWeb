    INGREDIENTS:
    <br />
    <br />
    1 cup brown lentils
    <br />
1 cup basmati rice
    <br />
1 cup uncooked pasta (small shells or elbow macaroni is best)
    <br />
2 large onions, diced
    <br />
4 cloves garlic, minced
    <br />
2 tablespoons oil
    <br />
1 (400 g) can chopped tomatoes
    <br />
1⁄4 teaspoon crushed red chili pepper flakes (or more to taste)
<br />
salt and black pepper
    <br /><br />
    How To Cook It:
    <br />
<br />
1.  Cook the lentils in just over a litre of salted water.
<br />
2.  Bring to a boil, reduce the heat and simmer, covered, for 15-30 minutes, depending on the type of lentils you are using.
<br />
3.  When the lentils are quite tender, add the rice to the lentils and continue simmering until the rice is cooked, adding water if necessary.
<br />
4.  Cook the macaroni in a separate pot.
<br />
5.  Rinse and strain when done.
<br />
6.  Meanwhile, fry the onions and garlic in the oil until golden.
<br />
7.  Add the tomatoes, chilli flakes, salt and pepper to taste and let it bubble for 10-20 minutes or until thickened and sauce like.
<br />
8.  You can now blitz the sauce in a food processor until smooth or just leave as is.
<br />
9.  Mix the lentils, rice and macaroni together in one pot.
<br />
10. Place some of the lentil mixture on each plate and top with tomato sauce.
<br />
11. Sprinkle with more hot chili powder or salt and pepper, if desired.
