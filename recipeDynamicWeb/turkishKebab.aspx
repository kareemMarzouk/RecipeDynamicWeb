    Name: Turkish Kebab<br />
    Submitted by: Zain<br />
    Prepare Time: 00:18:00<br />
    <br />
    INGREDIENTS:
    <br /><br />
    1 cup whole-milk Greek yogurt 
    <br />
    2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice, or more to taste 
    <br />
    2 tablespoons olive oil 
    <br />
    2 tablespoons ketchup 
    <br />
    6 cloves garlic, minced 
    <br />
    1 tablespoon Aleppo red pepper flakes 
    <br />
    1 tablespoon kosher salt 
    <br />
    1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin 
    <br />
    1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 
    <br />
    1 teaspoon paprika 
    <br />
    1/8 teaspoon ground cinnamon 
    <br />
    2 1/2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs, halved
    <br />
    4 long metal skewers
    <br /><br />
    How To Cook It:
    <br /><br />
1.Whisk yogurt, lemon juice, olive oil, ketchup, garlic, red pepper flakes, salt, cumin, black pepper, paprika, and cinnamon together in a bowl.
    <br />
2.Place chicken thigh halves into the yogurt marinade and coat them thoroughly on all sides. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate 2 to 8 hours.
    <br />
3.Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.
    <br />
4.Using 2 skewers for each kebab, thread half of the chicken thighs onto each pair of skewers making a fairly thick "log" shape.
    <br />
5.Place kebabs on grill. Do not try to turn them until they begin to unstick from the grill, 3 or 4 minutes. Turn kebabs and grill the other side 3 or 4 minutes; turn. Continue cooking and turning until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 6 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
