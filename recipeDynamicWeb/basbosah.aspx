    Prepare Time: 00:20:00<br />
    <br />
    INGREDIENTS:
<br /><br />
2½ cups coarse semolina
    <br />
90 g (1 cup) desiccated coconut
    <br />
220 g (1 cup) caster sugar
    <br />
75 g (½ cup) self-raising flour
    <br />
200 g thick yoghurt
    <br />
200 g unsalted butter, melted
    <br />
1 tsp vanilla extract
    <br />
25–30 g blanched almonds 
    <br />
milk, if needed
    <br /><br />
How To Cook It:
    <br /><br />
1.Preheat the oven to 190°C. Mix the semolina, coconut, sugar, flour, yoghurt, melted butter and vanilla in a bowl. If the mixture seems too thick, add a little milk, but it should still be fairly stiff. Spread the mixture with your hands into a buttered 30 cm x 25 cm x 5 cm baking tray. Cut it into diamond shapes, pressing hard. Place an almond in the centre of each diamond. Bake for 35–40 minutes or until golden brown.
    <br />
2.Meanwhile, make the syrup. Place the sugar and water in a saucepan and bring to the boil, stirring until the sugar dissolves. Simmer for 5 minutes without stirring. Stir in the lemon juice and rosewater and remove from the heat. Leave to cool.
    <br />
3.Pour the syrup over the cake while the cake is still hot. Cool to serve.
