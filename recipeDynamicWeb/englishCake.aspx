    INGREDIENTS:
    <br /><br />
    3 cups sifted all-purpose flour 
    <br />
    1/4 teaspoon baking soda 
    <br />
    1/4 teaspoon salt 
    <br />
    1 cup butter, room temperature 
    <br />
    3 cups white sugar 
    <br />
    6 eggs, room temperature 
    <br />
    1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract

    1 cup sour cream
    <br /><br />
    How To Cook It:

    <br />
2.Sift together the flour, baking soda and salt. Set aside.
    <br />
3.In a large bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. It should be noticeably lighter in color. Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in vanilla, orange and almond extracts. Blend in the flour mixture, alternating with the sour cream, until fully incorporated. Pour batter into prepared pan.
    <br />
4.Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, about 70 minutes. Allow cake to cool on rack before removing from pan to cool completely.
